          <p>
            I've been playing the guitar and singing in a punk band for the last
            5 years
          </p>
          <p>
            It's been an adventure with a lot of ups and downs, (hello covid
            pandemic!) but I love it and wouldn't give it up for anything else
          </p>
          <p>
            Playing music I like, travelling to new places, meeting new
            people... It makes me happy and proud!

          <h3>Why I'm proud of it</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I get to play music I like in front of people</li>
            <li>It's my teenage dream come true (let's be honest)</li>
            <li>
              I'm proud of the music skills I gained over the years, along with
              my bandmates
            </li>
            <li>I look cool on a stage!</li>
            <li>
              I like overcoming the nervousness before a show and just playing
              through in spite of it
            </li>
            <li>
              I stuck around playing and putting energy into my band, even when it
              was hard or I had a busy life
            </li>
            <li>
              People enjoy it! Someome often comes to us at the end of a show to
              tell us they loved it
            </li>

          <h3>How I try to stay humble about it</h3>
          <ul><li>Listening and playing with great bands and being in awe in front of their music</li>
            <li>Same x10: listening to other genres than punk üòÅ</li>
          <li>Listening to my bandmates' opinions (and sometimes having little fights) about what and how I play</li>
          <li>Trying to play new things and realising I have sooo much more to learn</li>
          <li>Not paying attention to the hordes of my fans (easy, as they are also not paying attention to me)</li>
          <li>Trying to stay nice and to reflect on myself I guess?</li>
