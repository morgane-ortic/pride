          <p>
            I've been playing the guitar and singing in a punk band for the last
            5 years
          </p>
          <p>
            It's been an adventure with a lot of ups and downs, (hello covid
            pandemic!) but I love it and wouldn't give it up for anything else
          </p>
          <p>
            Playing music I like, travelling to new places, meeting new
            people... It makes me happy and proud!
          </p>

          <h3>Why I'm proud of it</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I get to play music I like in front of people</li>
            <li>It's my teenage dream come true (let's be honest)</li>
            <li>
              I'm proud of the music skills I gained over the years along with
              my bandmates
            </li>
            <li>I look cool on a stage!</li>
            <li>
              I like overcoming the nervousness before a show and just playing
              through in spite of it
            </li>
            <li>
              I kept on playing and putting energy into my band, even when it
              was harder or had a busy life
            </li>
            <li>
              People enjoy it! Someome often comes to us at the end of a show to
              tell us they loved it
            </li>
