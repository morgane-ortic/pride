          <p>
            I've been playing the guitar and singing in a punk band for the last
            5 years
          </p>
          <p>
            It's been an adventure with a lot of ups and downs, (hello covid
            pandemic!) but I love it and wouldn't give it up for anything else
          </p>
          <p>
            Playing music I like, travelling to new places, meeting new
            people... It makes me happy and proud!

              Their letters never arrive (unless it's totally unimportant info)

          <h3>How I'm overcoming it:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Knowing my rights (they don't but will always pretend they do)
            </li>
            <li>Going to appointments with someone to support me</li>
            <li>DeepL (Ãœberhochdeutsch letters I'm not afraid of you!)</li>
            <li>
              Getting better than them at german bureaucracy (high-level task)
            </li>
